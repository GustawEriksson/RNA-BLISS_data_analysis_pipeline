The RNA-BLISS data analysis pipeline for RNA-sequencing and BLISS data, is used
to  

aDNA Toolbox is a command-line toolbox applied on BAM-files, to be used for
analyzing aDNA to illustrate concepts of C to T substitutions, patterns of
overlapping reads and nucleotide frequency at the ends of reads. Furthermore,
the toolbox allows the user to reconstruct aDNA molecules by reconstructing it
with the use of MD-tags and CIGAR-string. The program was developed using Python
version 3.7.1 and the Atom Editor version 1.29.0.

The program requires the use of samtools, which either can be downloaded locally
from samtools website http://www.htslib.org/download/ or using package manager.
aDNA Toolbox was written with samtools version 1.9 using htslib version 1.9.
